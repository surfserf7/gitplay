There are many options for installing 'git' on your machine.
Commandline versions exist for various operating systems as
well as GUI front ends. There are source make/make-install
options, package manager options, etc. etc. The internet is
our friend.

Once something is installed, you need to set up a couple of
global options:

  $ git config --global user.name "John Doe"
  $ git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com

There are other options. You can set a default editor or a
diff tool, etc. Check settings by typing:

  $ git config --list
