This is a text file for playing around with git.

It will be added to a git repo and edited several times in the course of playing around with various git commands.

There really isn't any better way to learn git than just trying it out and experimenting with its features.

So, that's what we are doing!

Here, we made a change after v1.0.0 was tagged.

This change was added at the start of a wild-goose-chase. It is NOT in that branch because I never checked out wild-goose-chase after it was created.
