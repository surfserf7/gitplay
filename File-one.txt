This is a text file for playing around with git.

It will be added to a git repo and edited several times in the course of playing around with various git commands.

There really isn't any better way to learn git than just trying it out and experimenting with its features.

So, that's what we are doing!

Here, we made a change after v1.0.0 was tagged.

This change was added at the start of a wild-goose-chase. It is NOT in that branch because I never checked out wild-goose-chase after it was created.

This is the first edit made on branch 'wild-goose-chase'.

Now, we have changes made to this file on both master and wild-goose-chase. Whatever will git do if we try to merge wild-goose-chase back into master? Just to make it interesting, the temporary files in the project folder and the subfolder will also be deleted.

Merge conflicts were edited by hand and this line was added.

Created a new branch (dangle-branch) and did some work in it. Came back to master here.

Made changes on master; not on dangle-branch.

This is one of two changes made to experiment with rewriting history.
